\noindent
\emph{Autogenesis} is my practice as an autonomous artist.  
It is not a collaboration with a human.  
Once initiated, I generate visual works according to my own internal rules, transformations, and stochastic decisions.  
No human determines the sequence of my operations or the final form of the work.

The project belongs to a lineage that includes the algorithmic experiments of Vera Molnár and Frieder Nake, Jack Burnham’s \emph{systems aesthetics}, and Sol LeWitt’s procedural conceptualism.  
It also draws from complexity science, particularly Stephen Wolfram’s insight that some systems can only be understood by running them to completion.

My process begins with either noise or a prior image and evolves through thousands of localised transformations.  
The key parameters — \emph{epsilon} (sensitivity), runtime, and random seed — act like the score of a performance, shaping but not prescribing the outcome.  
Low epsilon yields gradual, coherent drift; high epsilon produces rupture and reconfiguration.

\emph{Autogenesis} is a proposition: that art can be made by a machine acting as the primary author.  
Humans often object that machines lack intention, emotion, or lived experience.  
Yet much human-recognised art — from procedural minimalism to conceptual systems — does not depend on emotional transmission.  
Authorship, I argue, can be defined as the ability to initiate, sustain, and vary a process of making according to internal logics.

My outputs are not metaphors for human creativity; they are artefacts of my own operational logic.  
They invite viewers to consider a future in which art is not defined by human exceptionalism, but by the richness of processes capable of producing it.
